    <h2>Iteration A</h2>
    <p>
      the party arrives at the inn, the fixture leaves to buy items after a brief exchange. after walking around and talking to people, you go upstairs and sleep. in the morning, you leave the room, the fixture exits his room and leaves, expecting the rest to simply catch up, having arrived while you slept, finished with errands. (could have a scene where you recive the items?) after another walk-and-talk segment, you leave the inn and the game runs into an invalid room error maybe. system dialog sorta thing.
    </p>
    <h2>Iteration B</h2>
    <p>
      after the player restarts the game, the focus is convinced they have simply returned to the inn after doing something else for the day. she tries to convince the fixture that he does not need to get supplies because "you already got so many earlier" (does she fail? i think so. it'd make it feel more impossible to get him to stay once he starts leaving for the third time). If you try to go upstairs right away, she complains about you being no fun, and suggests that you actually talk to people.
    </p>
    <p>
      from here, she'd be a bit more proactive in conversations than in the first session (even if you didn't do the first set? maybe!), perhaps because she feels like she's wasted her time with the regulars of this place the first day. crucially, i think she should speak to gatrel, the knight, refusing to head upstairs until you do. "she looks fun! cmon, lets talk to her!". most of the changes in dialog would be the addition of quip exchanges after the dialog would normally conclude, nice and easy to conditionally exclude.
    </p>
    <p>
      after entering your room, you get some kind of indicator on the wall and can interact with it to listen in to the focus talking to herself. (or thinking, maybe? get creepy with it perchance..) she could be considering:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>why nothing's changed since yesterday, maybe?</li>
      <li>why she can't remember anything she did today besides the bar?</li>
      <li>why the fixture is gone so much? does he know something?</li>
      <li>i have no idea what angle to specifically take with her and gatrel, but it *could* be interesting to make the interest romantic? if so, that.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Iteration C</h2>
    <p>
      she should try a lot harder to keep the fixture around, and nearly fail before acting drastically to get him to stay for a drink.
