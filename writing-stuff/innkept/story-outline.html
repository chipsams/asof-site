    <h2>Iteration A</h2>
    <p>
      the party arrives at the inn, the fixture leaves to buy items after a brief exchange. after walking around and talking to people, you go upstairs and sleep. in the morning, you leave the room, the fixture exits his room and leaves, expecting the rest to simply catch up, having arrived while you slept, finished with errands. (could have a scene where you recive the items?) after another walk-and-talk segment, you leave the inn and the game runs into an invalid room error maybe. system dialog sorta thing.
    </p>
    <h2>Iteration B</h2>
    <p>
      after the player restarts the game, the focus is convinced they have simply returned to the inn after doing something else for the day. she tries to convince the fixture that he does not need to get supplies because "you already got so many earlier" (does she fail? i think so. it'd make it feel more impossible to get him to stay once he starts leaving for the third time). If you try to go upstairs right away, she complains about you being no fun, and suggests that you actually talk to people.
    </p>
    <p>
      from here, she'd be a bit more proactive in conversations than in the first session (even if you didn't do the first set? maybe!), perhaps because she feels like she's wasted her time with the regulars of this place the first day. crucially, i think she should speak to gatrel, the knight, refusing to head upstairs until you do. "she looks fun! cmon, lets talk to her!". most of the changes in dialog would be the addition of quip exchanges after the dialog would normally conclude, nice and easy to conditionally exclude.
    </p>
    <p>
      after entering your room, you get some kind of indicator on the wall and can interact with it to listen in to the focus talking to herself. (or thinking, maybe? get creepy with it perchance..) she could be considering:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>why nothing's changed since yesterday, maybe?</li>
      <li>why she can't remember anything she did today besides the bar?</li>
      <li>why the fixture is gone so much? does he know something?</li>
      <li>i have no idea what angle to specifically take with her and gatrel, but it *could* be interesting to make the interest romantic? if so, that.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Iteration C</h2>
    <p>
      she should try a lot harder to keep the fixture around, and nearly fail before acting drastically to get him to stay for a drink. she tries to act normally for a bit, enjoying the drink before attempting to bring up wierd things she's noticed. the fixture should shut her down, appearing almost out of character in the process. like "even he wouldn't be this mean.", reflecting her perspective and also making the player agree with her when she flies off the rails at him about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      he leaves after getting yelled at, lapsing back into the talk of needing to buy items. at this point, the focus will probably be slightly defeated, and stay quiet or potentially even shut down conversations. difficult to really say how a conversation with the knight would go at this point, maybe some kind words that end up not being replicable later?
    </p>
    <p>
      when you're in your room that night, the focus would have another stream of thoughts, culminating in her leaving her room at night to look around and catch her breath. you can leave your room and join her, at which point you can explore the inn with no-one around. she won't let you return til you find a key behind the bar, maybe?
    </p>
    <p>
      she's still convinved this is a more normal kind of magical problem, maybe? she's trying to find the source. with the key, there's an optional scene where you can take her out to a balcony and she can breathe for a moment, but the only way to progress is to take her into a cellar under the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      the cellar extends into the darkness in one direction longer than is plausible, getting harder and harder to navigate until she starts to realize there might not even be anything real causing her to be trapped. a fruitless persuit. (not certain on this ordering. could make sense to position the balcony scene as coming after the cellar always? a release valve. she gets to see something of the outside world, for a moment.)
    </p>
    <p>
      in the morning, she's pretty drained, but probably feels a little better for actually getting to see an "outside", even. maybe she tries to talk about it with the knight? who would not really get it. something vaugely supportive but nothing really like after the outburst. kinda crushing her a little :(..<br>
      she'd still mostly be back to how she was in Iteration A though for conversations, albeit with different dialog if you've already talked to them.
    </p>
    <h2>Iteration D</h2>
    ideas getting shaky.. here's what i got..
    <ul>
      <li>she tries getting the balcony key herself, but fails. it's not there at all?</li>
      <li>she probably would still suspect the fixture? not sure how to work that in, as she wouldn't bother convincing him to stay at this point..</li>
      <li>she tries talking to the knight about how wierd she's being, and the knight is even more unresponsive, not even acknoledging her at all, almost.</li>
    </ul>
