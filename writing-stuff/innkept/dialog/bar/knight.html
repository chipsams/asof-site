          KN: REALLY? I'M EVER SO GLAD TO HEAR THAT :V<br>
          KN: AS YOU APPEAR TO HAVE GLEANED,<br>
          KN: KINDA A BIG DEAL HERE!! I'M ON A QUEST, YOU SEE :O<br>
          KN: I'LL PROBABLY SAVE THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD WORLD, WITH HOW IT'S BEEN GOING :D<br>

          KN: I COULD NEVER PART WITH ARMOR *THIS* FINE &gt;:&lt;<br>
          KN: IT'S NOT THAT HEAVY TO ME THOUGH :?<br>
          KN: ARE YOU NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR IT? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE LIKE THAT :/<br>
          FO: I know right? You're practically a novice! Try harder so I don't have to bite as many axes, mkay?<br>

        <details>
          <summary>"Any fighting tips?"</summary>
          KN: JUST HIT EM LMAO :P<br>
          KN: IN SERIOUSNESS, YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU KEEP YOUR GROUND<br>
          KN: RETREATING FOR EVEN A SECOND COULD OPEN YOU UP TO AN ATTACK THAT ACTUALLY HURTS >:O<br>
          FI: I'm not sure if that adds up. Backing up means enemies miss you around 80% of the time, and it's usually a much less weighty blow.<br>
          FI: Hero, don't listen to this cretin. We should get out of the way if we're hurt.<br>

              KN: WHAT, WHY :?<br>
              FO: You *do* have a massive unarmored tail. Seems like a pretty big armor oversight, girl!<br>
              KN: JUST DON'T RETREAT AND IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER IF YOU DO OR DO NOT HAVE A TAIL :D<br>
              KN: PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY NEVER CONSIDERING THIS. MAKES YOU THINK :><br>
              FO: Can't argue with that! We should listen to her, is what i think!<br>
