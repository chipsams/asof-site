        <li>We're getting a hero's discount</li>
        <li>The room's rat-infested</li>
        <li>They're practically going under</li>
      </ol>

            FO: Hey! Those were some refined juices! Aromatic and flavorsome! You'd know if you weren't off doing whatever it is you do!<br>
            FI: For your information, I was using a tenth of that to get the [consumables? (to be decided)] keeping us alive. Hero tends to forget, and you can't be trusted, so it's left to me.<br>
