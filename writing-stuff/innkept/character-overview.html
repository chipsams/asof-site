      the game takes place in a single inn building, a much smaller scene of a true game, of generic fantasy bent. focuses on what it would mean to be a character in a world that is not finished, and to exist in a narrative in general, perhaps
    </p>
    
    <h2>the bearer of teeth (the focus)</h2>
    <li>central focus of the narrative i'm doing..</li>
    <li>body covered in mouths, wears a towel</li>
    <li>in the true game, would only be around for one chapter, after that can just be found in an inn (game could break in order to make her enact these conversations)</li>
    <li>will notice her boundaries</li>
    <li>will not enjoy that</li>
    
    <h2>scenes</h2>
    <p>
      slowly dawns on her that no one acknowledges the teeth thing, gets madder and madder about it til she threatens to bite someone, and everyone just patiently waits for her to finish. like "yeah. we know. stop making a scene." this is thematics because:
      <ol>
        <li>non literal here sorta. like everyone else is nearly incapable of noticing the nature of the world, but she feels like they're all just very agreeable to the narrative</li>
        <li>for the teeth thing it stems from all the dialog not being written with the character designs in mind at all. to make her more scared about being a placeholder or in the wrong place or something</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    
    <h2>the bearer of robe (the fixture)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>tall wizardry figure, perhaps</li>
      <li>is supposed to accompany the hero throughout the whole true game</li>
      <li>relatively dry kind of humor, mostly too serious</li>
      <li>analytical, but not present for most of the game. shows up near the beginning of the scene, leaves soon after for an errand</li>
      <li>if the focus is desperate, she may ask the fixture questions the next time things begin again, or if a weird misplaced bit of dialogue contains some of the fixtures lines</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>scenes</h2>
    <p>the focus tries to convince the fixture to not leave, potentially gets him to stay for a drink. once he's in, grills him about wierd stuff she's noticed, but he's excessively dismissive, should be ideally beyond what seems in-character</p>
    
    <h2>the bearer of it (the hero)</h2>
    - blank, almost placeholdery design
    - player character
    - inspires fear in the focus of her own potential placeholder nature. what if even if the world were finished she wouldn't be in it?
    - i kinda want to do something with it, but like. i'm no boby fox, i don't think i have anything extra to say on this right now that isn't just kris deltarune..
    - could have the focus project onto it and try to provoke a response and stuff like that?
    
    # <h2>moonkid (the sprite)</h2>
    moon with legs
    the face of the true game they are from. brings up the quest
    acts as the "straight man" from the perspective of the true game in response to the focus' experiences
    
    # <h2>gatrel (the knight)</h2>
    alligator woman in plate armor
    a single-room character, even more limited in scope than the focus
    would serve as a way for the focus to look at themselves from the outside. she'd attempt to talk to them and hit the knights edges immediately
    would have some small break from her boundaries, but wouldn't be able to remember anything between conversations. standard RPG looping dialog
