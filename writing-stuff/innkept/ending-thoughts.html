        there's a few different ways this could end. i'm not certain which one would leave the most interesting impression and solidify the characterization the most though..
    </p>
    <h3>option one! "carve out a new future"</h3>
    <p>
        the focus, understanding the nature of her world, could attempt to recreate the world from the ground up, using everything she can find about what it was "supposed" to be.
    </p>
    <h3>option two! "today, forever, with you."</h3>
    <p>
        desperate to see the knight as a full person, she could decide that the conversation must simply never end.
    </p>
    <h3>option three! "i have to leave."</h3>
    <p>
        the focus, understanding that there is nothing left for her in the inn, resolves to go somewhere else. far away. unclear if this is just a means of coping or a genuine method of escape. either way, you never see her again when opening the game.
