                            a really intriging and pretty experience.. navigate a dying alien biocomputer to solve a mystery!! a really really cool part about it is that it's all made out of standard html elements.. as of right now, it's all 3d-transforms with naray a canvas in sight..
                    </td></tr>
                    <tr><td>splatoon 2: octo expansion</td><td>
                            the story mode that i think best exemplifies some of what i like about splatoon.. it's a challenging gameplay experience, shore.. but there's also a great story there!! there's some information revealed as you play through memcakes and chatlogs, and a fantastic conclusion that i think really exemplifies eight's whole deal..<br>
                            this is eight: <img src="../img/eight.gif" width="40"/>

                            a timeloop at the very end of an rpg adventure!! play as the looping rouge, siffrin, as you help your party defeat the king.. it's great being in a position to help everyone else, isn't it?
