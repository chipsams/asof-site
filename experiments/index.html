                        all the folded sections are folded because it can be more interesting to just dive in and try to work out what the thing is yourself i think!!

                            gather resources, create machines to do it for you, better. all these resources seem very pre-refined. wonder why?

                            cards stack when they have identical operators, or the digit is one greater or lesser than the one it is being placed on. e.g. [2+] could stack on [9+], or [5-] could stack on [6*].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            the goal is to create expressions that form the numbers shown in the targets list. the expressions are taken in the order digit-operator-digit, noting that each card has both a digit and operator. the stack is evaluated from the bottom card to the top, not considering pedmas.

                        fun secret about this one: there's no actual lose conditon! i never bothered to implement it. it's still rather fun to manage your card resources, i think. nines are a little worthless, as it stands, but all cards are evenly provided. if i was to work on this more i'd probably make it a bit less completely random, to make it more fair.

                        this thing lets you build up your own definitions and notes for toki pona, and has some nice simple sorting and searching tools to let you manage your stuff.
                        there's a delete (with a simple recycling bin that clears when you refresh), 4 colored categories, some buttons to filter by said categories and a search bar.
                        there's also a side panel you can open for storing phrases you're translating or other notes! i made and then used it for <a href="https://lipu-sona.pona.la/">this toki pona course</a>, although i lost focus partway through as i tend to do.. needless to say, i hope i can follow through on it at some point!!
