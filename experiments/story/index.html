        <li>survival is [literal/abstractly] simply warmth. she doesn't need to eat or drink. maybe sleep</li>
        <li>there's nothing alive in the woods besides the trees, at least as far as she can tell</li>

      <h1>writing</h1>
      <p>the world: it appears to be only trees, as far as the mists of the storm can show.</p>
      <p>within this world, there is a cabin, and someone within.</p>
      <p>she takes from the trees, feeds a fire, and is granted safety from the storm through warmth.</p>
      <p>this is how it is [forever] (represent long span of time somehow)</p>
      <p>some day, the storm stills slightly. she can step outside safely</p>
      <p>feeling that the outside no longer whips and drowns, she wonders if fire will last when taken from the cabin</p>
      <p>she takes a piece of still-burning firewood, and places it outside. it remains lit</p>
      <p>she wants the world to be as safe as the warmed cabin, and assembles a pile of firewood, lighting it</p>
      <p>she is warmed. looking out at the somewhat cleared mists, she sees still no end to the woods</p>
      <p>could she spread this new bastion of safety further? trees are made of firewood, so perhaps cutting too is unneccesary.</p>
